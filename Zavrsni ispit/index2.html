						<p><b>We want to facilitate this kind of football, by advising the football players and provide assistance, in all matters that should be well arranged.
						These business matters are not as common for football players, as the game with the ball. We take care of all important business matters and provide the football players with maximum comfort.
						Because the players know their business interests are always taken care of. We do this in good times but especcialy when times are rough.</b></p>
						</div>
						<div class="text">
						<p><b>We provide our players with advice and take appropriate actions when needed.
						So that our players can do what they are good at. Giving pleasure to the public by displaying their football skills on the field.
						This enables our players to have a free mind. Because one thing is for sure, that is, that both sports and business matters are properly taken care of.
						The footballer can have a free mindset and let their feet and athletic ability do the rest. The public has now nothing else to do, then to enjoy the players on the field.</b></p>
